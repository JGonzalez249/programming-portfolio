- [Work 2](sketches/asteroids)

Based on Asteroids, you can control your ship and destroy asteroids, however, for some reason the more you destroy, the more shapes that spawn. Try to see if your can keep your score for as long as possible.

- [Work 3](sketches/haikuGenerator)

Using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a Haiku Generator with lines taken from around the web. When the user clicks on a line, it fades out and fades in a new line. The user can make thousands of combinations using this randomized generator.
