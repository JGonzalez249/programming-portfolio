            <h2 id="exTitle">The Physical and Digital Colliding</h2>
            <p id="description">
                Virtual Entertainment has come along way so far, Kizuna Ai and others like Hololive, Nijisanjin and VShojo keep pushing the boundaries of
                what's possible when it comes to completely embodying a virtual avatar and using the advantages of the virtual environment. We have seen what can be done to bring the digital into the physical world, the perfect
                example being Tupac at Coachella as a digital avatar or Hatsune Miku performing for a live audience. However, bringing a physical person into the digital world is a much more complex endeavor.

            </p>
            <p id="description">Thankfully, we can see some of the potenial of a purely virtual concert with physical elements, Kizuna Ai's US tour during mid 2021, showed the incredible use of a purely virtual environment to create impossible scenarios.
                Gravity defying camera movements, particle effects that would be dangerous to do in real-life with an audience, the instant change of an avatar'ss outfit during mid transistion to a new song, the
                appearance and disappearance of quests at any time, etc.
            </p>
            <p id="description">This highlight video of Kizuna Ai's concerts show an excellent example of a virtual concert in action:</p>

          <p id="description">
            Here is a another great example of the digital and physical colliding for entertainment, this time for a normal talk show/podcast.
            This is Trash Taste interviewing Calliope Mori from HololiveEN in their studio.

          <p id="description">We can see more clearly that virtual avatars are being more accepted in society in general, even though it's not truely in the mainstream yet, it's almost there.
              In fact, brands are now starting to realize the potential in a virtual avatar, especially since they can create them specifically to promote their products.
          </p>
          <h2 id="exTitle">Corporate VTubers</h2>
          <p id="description">Not too surprisingly, you will see a rise in VTubers promoting products for different companies, it's currently happening now with the one of the first corporate VTubers being from Air Asia.
              It's called Project Kavvaii with it's first VTuber offically sponsored by Air Asia named Aozora Kurumi. This would open a door for other companies to create their own VTubers.
              Two major companies with access to a vast collection of anime, finally decided to make their own VTubers, one is CrunchyRoll and the other is Netflix. CrunchyRoll used the mascot they've had for years
              and just decided to make her a VTuber, CrunchyRoll Hime. Netflix woud make an original VTuber named N-ko, to be their brand ambassador for anime.
              This once again would open another door for more companies to start to create their own VTubers, such as the recently announced VTuber from computer laptop
              manufacturer MSI.

        <p id="description">Don't be surprised when you start to see a brand you like to start advertising their products with VTubers.
            However, that brings up another possibility, when thinking about virutal entertainers, they can't really stand out in the physical world too much due to limitations in physics.
            For a purely digital world like the Metaverse, the possibilities for VTubers are near endless.
            Imagine a world where you can interact with not just physical people but also digital people because of the Metaverse. These VTubers
            are just really just people embodying a digital shell behind the screen, eventually I can see this become the norm where talking to digital entity in the physical space
            is just like speaking to a physical person and others around can also see who or what you're talking too.
