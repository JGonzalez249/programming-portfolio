          <h2 id="exTitle">The Models</h2>
          <p id="description">
            The one thing that makes a vtuber work is the model, however, since the independent scene is quite large there are a larger variety of different types
            of VTubers. In fact, there is the term PNGTuber, which is basically a person interacting with the audience as a PNG image,
            some streamers have even taken the concept and added reactions with a different set of images. However, the first instance of VTubers were using advanced 3D models, such a Ami Yamato and Kizuna Ai.
            Commissioning a 3D model can be a large investment, however, because of the community, open source software has allowed
            any person to get a 3D model working and ready to go in a matter of hours. VRoid Studio is a great example of a easy way to get in VTubing for 
            any person.
          </p>
          <p id="description">Here is an example:</p>
          <iframe 
          class="video"
          width="560" 
          height="315" 
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKp6PU4mFg" 
          title="YouTube video player" 
          frameborder="0" 
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
          allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>

          <p id="description">
            After 3D models, 2D models with advanced rigging came into the picture, at first, they were crude but quickly became the most popular
            form of VTuber model. This is due to the fact that, while it's even more expensive to commission a 2D model, it vastly saves on
            much needed computer resources. Expensive and high-end PCs aren't something that most people have, such a PC would allow them to
            interact with their trackers, sensors, render their 3d model in real-time while also live streaming at the same time, this would be very expensive
            on the CPU and GPU. 2D models have the advantage of using very little GPU performance, so it would allow them to stream at higher quality and play
            more graphically intensive games. Other resources like Unity and Blender help create and rig 3D models.

          </p>
          <p id="description">Here is an example of the 2D model process:</p>
          <iframe 
          class="video"
          width="560" 
          height="315" 
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LKpPtXF0vg" 
          title="YouTube video player" 
          frameborder="0" 
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
          allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>

          <h2 id="exTitle">Tracking</h2>
          <p id="description">
            Another important aspect of VTubing is the tracking, depending on the model, the tracking can either be complex
            and uses a motion tracker suit or even just using an iPhone camera to track. Some are so advanced that it can do whole body tracking with the 
            model doing a one-to-one actions in real-time, Zentreya and Projekt Melody from VShojo comes to mind. Projekt
            Zentreya has some of the most expressive models in the business with near perfect tracking, here is an example:
          <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3u1NXB_plI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </p>

            <p id="description">Here is a more in-depth example from Code Miko:</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WANNA SEE SOME TECH?!! This is Miko being mocapped live by technician with facial tracking! <a href="https://t.co/a3A5gLWANv">pic.twitter.com/a3A5gLWANv</a></p>&mdash; Miko (@thecodemiko) <a href="https://twitter.com/thecodemiko/status/1332954045326082049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 

            <p id="description">
                As for 2D tracking, it's much simpler. While some may want to use a camera which good face and eye tracking and working 
                in many different light conditions, an iPhone is usually sufficient for most applications. With a good rigger, you can have access to a wide range of reactions
                while live streaming.

          </p>
          <p id="description">Here is an example of excellent 2D tracking:</p>
          <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSu33MKLIQQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <h2 id="exTitle">Audience Particpation</h2>
          <p id="description">
            What makes VTubing an interactive experience is the fact that you can directly interact with the virtual avatar, whether through new software just introduced
            to VTube Studio or getting on VRChat and interacting in virtual reality with the VTuber. Audience particpation plays a large part in this medium, without it, it more than likely would not have taken 
            off in the West. There are many instances of the live stream chat collectively interacting with the VTuber through the use of the tools provided
            to them by the VTuber themselves. Froot from VShojo has a sound board that the chat can play if they donate enough money to play it, the chat in this case, annoys Froot with the
            soundboard until she dies in Crab Game (a Squid Game inspired game).
            <p id="description">WARNING LOAD VOLUME!</p>
            <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTFHtzbQQl8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </p>

        <h3 id="exTitle">Virtual Reality</h3>
        <p id="description">
            A large role that gave raise to the medium is VR. Virtual Reality allows VTubers to interact with people digitally and can create events that allow
            people to attend in real-time. Kizuna Ai, so far, always attempts to push the boundaries of virtual reality mixed with physical reality. Her recent concerts has her and other guests, either virtual or physcial
             on stage to sing and dance with her. For others, VR is used to hang out with their audience or friends, either to play games with either or talk to each other. Here is an example of VTubers Nyanners and Ironmouse of VShojo
             interacting in VR with each other and showing off to their audience.
            </p>
            <iframe class="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1SUoQmqWVoY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p id="description">
            The resources used by these VTubers has allowed the medium to grow at a rapid pace due to the audience particpation, this is followed by the expansion of the VTuber industry into
            music industry. Through the use of 3D Models, game engines like Unreal, and advanced full-body tracking has made possible large concerts and smaller events. The technology has matured so fast, that anybody can
            use the free resources available for use in order to express themselves and embody what they may preceive
            to be their true selves since they are free to design or commission any model they may free embodies thier personality.
