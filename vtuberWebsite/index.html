          <p id="description">
            VTubers are a new type of virtual entertainers that are prevalent on
            live stream platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, etc. with ten of
            thousands of vtubers on these platforms everyday. Combined
            veiwership is in the billions and some of these virtual entertainers
            are earning millions of dollars a month.
          </p>
          <p id="description">
            Ever since the rise of vtubers, new ways to consume entertainment
            and audience particpation as followed, while live streaming as
            always been popular due to streamers themselves interacting with the
            audience while showing themselves with a face cam, vtubers are
            different.
          </p>

          <p id="description">
            VTubers use a animated virtual avatar, it can be two dimensional or
            three dimensional, to live stream. With how easy it is to stream,
            while protecting your privacy due to the fact that the streamer
            embodies their virtual avatar without having to ever show their face
            and sometimes not even use their voice. With the amount of open
            source and free resources, this medium has exploded from a trend
            into a legitimate industry.
          </p>
          <p id="description">
            While new in the entertainment sector, these virtual avatars, that
            are controlled by people in real-time, are rapidly growing and
            attracting large brands that provide these vtubers with resources
            and sponsorships to attract large audiences. Their popularity in
            Japan has expanded to establishing companies and agencies to bring a group together for 
            the sake of entertainment like you would see in the music industry.
          </p>
          <p id="description">
            In fact, the VTuber industry does take inspiration from the music
            industry, especially in Japan, since many of these individuals or
            groups form idol groups and do attend or even perform concerts that
            will attract tens of thousands of people.
          </p>
          <p id="description">
            The first vtuber, at least in terms of what the definition of what a
            vtuber is currently, is Kizuna Ai. She first appeared in Japan as a
            YouTuber in 2016, early 2017 and quickly rose to prominence during
            2018/2019, she is currently part of Kizuna AI Inc., a subsidiary of
            the digital entertainment company Activ8.
