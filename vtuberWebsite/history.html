          <h2 id="exTitle">When did this start?</h2>
          <p id="description">
            VTubing is a relatively a new approach to entertainment that only
            just started around 2017 with the first "Official" VTuber called
            Kizuna Ai, who is considered a pioneer in this genre. However, the
            concept of a "VTuber" goes further back than 2017, in fact, there is
            currently a debate into what actually started the concept of a
            "VTuber". The definition, when first conceived, meant Virtual
            YouTuber that was exclusive to the video hosting site YouTube. Since
            then, it has expanded but the term still in use today since the term
            was normalized on YouTube with the rise of Kizuna Ai and others that
            started right after.
          </p>
          <p id="description">
            Before VTubing, however, the concepts and technologies involved in VTubing
            took years to mature into the phenomenon it is today. The whole
            concept of vlogging and using virtual avatars for
            self-representation has existed for some time now. Back in 2011, the
            UK-based Japanese vlogger Ami Yamato was the first relatively well
            known personality using a virtual avatar and it's mostly agreed by
            those in the community to be the first VTuber before it was even a
            thing. If anything, Ami Yamato was more about using her virtual
            avatar as an application for art and the technologies used in her
            application of this avatar would pave the way for Kizuna Ai.

          <h2 id="exTitle">Kizuna Ai</h2>
          <p id="description">
              During late 2016, a YouTuber by the name of Kizuna Ai first appeared
              on YouTube in Japan. She was created by Activ8 under the name of Project A.I. 
              to start a new method of entertainment and advertisement for the company that created her, 
              she would quickly move beyond what was expected of her. 
              What made her special compared to other YouTubers and others on the popular 
              Japanese video hosting site NicoNico at the time was the fact that she used a virtual avatar. 
              Now, what made Ami Yamato and Kizuna Ai different was the fact that Kizuna Ai
              did a much better job at gaining an audience compared to Ami. Kizuna
              Ai was a much more entertaining YouTuber and she would try to
              interact with her audience everytime she live streamed. It is also
              fortunate that she started in Japan, being a virtual anime avatar
              along with her fun personality would she her rise in Japan along
              with others who were quickly inspired by Kizuna Ai.

            <p id="description">
            During the years between 2017-2018, Kizuna Ai and others like her, 
            were a relatively niche part of Japan's entertainment industry, however, 
            it would start to quickly change when Kizuna Ai started doing events with her 
            audience both virtually and non-virtually. Her first live concert in 2018 called "hello world" caused a
            national stir due to the fact that, unlike Vocaloids like Hatsune Miku, Kizuna Ai is a real person but 
            never showed her face live at the concert and sang at the concert while embodying her avatar in real-time 
            while using holographic technology to project herself on stage.

          </p>
          <p id="description">
            However, Kizuna Ai wasn't the only thing stiring in Japan. A certain company would take the VTuber world 
            by storm and take VTubing ever closer to the mainstream.
          </p>
          <h2 id="exTitle">Hololive</h2>
          <p id="description">
            During 2016, the COVER Corporation was founded by Motoaki Tanigo with the company's focus 
            being on development of VR and AR applications/software. Soon after Kizuna Ai's debut in 2017, COVER would soon create a subsidiary
            called Hololive Production with its main focus being a new trend called a VTuber. After looking for an appropriate canidate,
            the first ever Hololive VTuber would debut on 7 September at 7pm JST, her name is Tokino Sora.
          </p>
          <div class="kizuna__side--hist">
            <div class="kizuna__side--container">
                <div class="kizuna__side--image">
                    <img src="images/Tokino_Sora_2020_Portrait.png" alt="Image of Tokino Sora" style="width:25%">
                  </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p id="description">
            Though nowhere near as popular as Kizuna Ai or others like her at the time, Tokino Sora was ultimately a successful VTuber for COVER
            which helped them look for new members to join Hololive. Eventually, other companies would start to crop up to follow in the
            success of Hololive. Using their own technology, Hololive had the most advanced HCI for VTubing and none, except the first 
            VTubers like Kizuna Ai, could provide the fluidity of their 2D and 3D avatars. The growing medium would be contained within Japan for sometime, 
            when many groups and companies trying their hand at this new form of entertainment, many would fail and none could challenge Hololive at the time.
            However, another company, and soon to be major rival to Hololive, Nijisanji would be founded in 2018 by ANYCOLOR Inc. (formerly known as Ichikara Inc. until May 16, 2021)
          </p>
        <p id="description">
            The rivalry between Hololive and Nijisanji would see the growth of the medium due to Hololive finally having competetion 
            with another major talent agency. These two juggernauts would compete for the best contracts for brands and advertisement, organized major events for fans, and
            eventually, start to form idol groups. Many of these VTubers (or Livers as Nijisanji would call them) that were hired by both companies were talented, especially with singing, which both companies
            took advantage of. While Kizuna Ai was looking to bring virtual entertainment into the physical at the time, both Hololive and Nijisanji
            used their strengths in VR/AR technology to quickly innovate the VTubing trend into a mainstream and highly popularized product.
          </p>
          <h2 id="exTitle">Outward Expansion</h2>
          <p id="description">Eventually, as with most companies, both COVER and ANYCOLOR Inc. wanted to expand their reach in order to 
              in profits using their talents. In 2019, both companies would expand into China next, however, controversy for Hololive due to Chinese
               nationalism would see their endeavors fail the following year in 2020 forcing them to shut down operations in China for good. Nijisanji would have better success 
               and they still have a foothold to this day. After the faliure that was hololive China, Cover would look to expand elsewhere in the south-west pacific, specifically the Indonesia where they show major success.
               Nijisanji would do the same and also have their own successes in both the Philippines and Korea and faliure in India.
          </p>
          <p id="description">
            After establshing in the South-West Pacific, Hololive would then set their sights on the West, specifically the United States.
            This would be their toughest expansion due to the radically different culture in regards to what Western audiences, specifically Americans, 
            consumed media. Luckly for Hololive and later Nijisanji, there is a large subculture in the US, specifically anime enthusiasts and more importantly gamers.
            The debut of HololiveEN was met with massive success to the point where now VTubing is starting to become a serious entertainment medium around the world.
            The technology and the talents involved created an interactive experience that is somewhat unique, as an audience member you can freely interact with the streamer when they live stream,
            however, it can go beyond that when these VTubers can directly interact with their audience using VR. HololiveEN was such a success that Nijisanji also expanded months later,
            not to the same degree and fanfare of HololiveEN but still a massive success either way.
          </p>
          <h2 id="exTitle">Western VTuber Emergence</h2>
          <p id="description">The budding Western VTuber industry, due to the arrival of Hololive, saw the emergence of fully Western VTubing agencies and independents, one of the first known agencies is Tsunderia founded in April 2020, a relatively stable
          and small group compared to the juggernauts like NijisanjiEN and HololiveEN with a splatter of independents making a name for themselves on YouTube and Twitch.
          Due to COVID lockdowns, this small industry practically grew to such a large degree in a single year than it ever did in Japan, while not to the same scale as Japan, the Western VTubing industry saw 
          growth that excelled the rate of adoption compared to Japan and other territories in one year combined.</p>
          <p id="description">During this period of rapid growth, many Western VTubers brought their brand of ingenuity, talent, style, and technology to the industry. Some of the technologies that emerged from many independents actually contributed the rapid adoption
            of VTubing in the West as well as the fact that it allowed hidden talents to bloom due to the safety that a 
            virtual avatar brought compared to other streamers who had been streaming with their real personas such Hasanabi, xQc, Pokimaine, etc.
            Many independents today come from all walks of life and that allowed the industry to diversify.
          </p>
          <p id="description">Eventually, all this talent in the West would spawn a competitor to both HololiveEN and NijisanjiEN. A group of VTubers who had teamed up in November 24, 2020 to create
            an new agency where the talents had total creative control over their content, which was a first in the industry. Both Hololive and Nijisanji as well as others from Japan and beyond, usually
            had some form of control over their talents. This company is called VShojo. They would be taking a risk to let all creative control go to the girls, however, it would make sense since all these VTubers were independents before forming the agency.
          </p>
          <div class="kizuna__side--hist">
            <div class="kizuna__side--container">
                <div class="kizuna__side--image">
                    <img src="images/vshojo_hist.jpg" alt="Image of Vshojo and Talents" style="width:100%">
                  </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p id="description">Each talent would bring something different to the table and would continue to innovate at a pace even faster than either Hololive or Nijisanji.
          Many would argue that the technology that VShojo uses surpassed that of Hololive and Nijisanji due to the fact that they
          aren't limited to the proprietary technology, models, and services of a single company. VShojo is allowed to collabrate and commission any artist and 2D/3D rigger they pleased, which 
          also brought even more talent into the limelight. They would rapidly gain momentum in the industry, while still small in comparison to both Hololive and Nijisanji as a company, 
          their talents have just as much and even surpassed talents from both Hololive and Nijisanji in viewership numbers and social outreach.
        </p>
        <h2 id="exTitle">Current</h2>
        <p id="description">As of now, the industry has slowed down in growth just a little due to the fact that lack of lockdowns and the normalization of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to
          people going back to their lives. However, it's still growing, especially in the West, independents are popping all over the US, UK, and EU with newer agency being established as well, such as CyberLive,
          who are following the VShojo model of a "Talent First" agency. Eventually, the industry will start to mature into a more mainstream entertainment option for society, bringing along innovations in interactive media.
